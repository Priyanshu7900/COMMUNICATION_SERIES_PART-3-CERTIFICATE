# Communication Series Part 3 - AXI in verilog

I successfully completed the **"Communication Series  - Part 3:
AXI in verilog"** course on Namaste FPGA,  learnt the essentials of AXI protocol with our hands-on course designed to get a deep understanding of AXI fundamentals in Verilog.  I dived into the different signals of AXI Stream, AXI Lite, and AXI Full interfaces, and learnt to build AXI Stream, AXI Lite, and AXI Full Master and Slave components from scratch. Implemented different burst modes, probe and verify AXI transactions using the AXI protocol checker, and built advanced components such as AXI Stream FIFOs, arbiters, and AXI Lite GPIO from the ground up. With extensive coding practice and essential theoretical insights, this course equiped me with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in design and verification roles.
